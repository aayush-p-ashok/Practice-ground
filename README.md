# Practice Ground
This is a repository to upload all our rough works.  
It includes practice problems, plots, ideas, and more.  
It also tracks our progression in Python skills.  
So jump around, play, and LEARN!

I know, everything looks overwhelming at first. Just ignore all other folders, files, and options, and follow the instructions below.

## Instructions
1. **COME INSIDE**: This is where all the work is uploaded.
2. **'.idea'**: This is an essential folder for git, but you can just ignore it.
3. **.ipynb** is a notebook file meant to opened in **Jupyter Lab** or **Google Colab**.

### Naming Convention  
- The project files are named in order, like `Es1`, `Es2`, `Es3`, etc., to keep the repository organized.  
- Here's a quick guide for file abbreviations:
  - **Es** - Electrostatics
  - **Mg** - Magnetostatics
  - **Ed** - Electrodynamics
  - **Mt** - Mathematics
  - **Ad** - Astrodynamics
  - **Fd** - Fluid Dynamics
- Use ! to flag the computationally intense programs.
The more ! you see, the toastier your CPU gets!
- Provide a clear title and a brief description of the problem being solved for each uploaded project.
- For each commit(update), summary/title should start by u1,u2,...uN and a concise message like:  
`u3 - Improved efficiency of loop in Es2 script` or `u5 - Fixed bug in plot rendering for Mg1`. Use * to indicate a major update as `u4*`
