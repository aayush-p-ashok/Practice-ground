'''Qn
Consider two point charges, q1 = +1 C located at position (0, 0) and q2 = -2 C located at (3, 0), in the xy-plane.
The electric potential V at any point P(x, y) in space due to a charge q is given by:

    V = (k * q) / r

where k is Coulombâ€™s constant and r is the distance from the point charge to P(x, y).

Tasks:
1. Write a function to compute the electric potential V at any point P(x, y) due to a point charge q located
at (x0, y0).

2. Calculate and plot the electric potential due to both charges at points in a grid across the xy-plane.
Use a suitable range for x and y (e.g., from -5 to 5) with sufficient resolution.

3. Identify and plot the locus of points where the net electric potential V_net due to both charges is zero.
This locus represents the curve along which the potential is zero.
