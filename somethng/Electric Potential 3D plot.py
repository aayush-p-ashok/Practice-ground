'''Qn
Consider two point charges, q1 = +1 C located at position (0, 0) and q2 = -2 C located at (3, 0), in the xy-plane.
The electric potential V at any point P(x, y) in space due to a charge q is given by:

    V = (k * q) / r

where k is Coulombâ€™s constant and r is the distance from the point charge to P(x, y).

Tasks:
1. Write a function to compute the electric potential V at any point P(x, y) due to a point charge q located
at (x0, y0).

2. Create a 3D plot of the Electric Potential against x and y axes
